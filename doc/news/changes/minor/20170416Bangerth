Changed: The PointValueHistory class still used the old, deprecated
interface for DataPostprocessor objects in that variant of the
PointValueHistory::evaluate_field() function that takes such an
object. This is now fixed: it uses
DataPostprocessor::evaluate_scalar_field() and
DataPostprocessor::evaluate_vector_field(), like all other
users of the DataPostprocessor class.
